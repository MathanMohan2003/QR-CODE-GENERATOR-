QR Code Generator Project in Python
Project Title: QR Code Generator using Python

Project Overview:
This project involves creating a QR Code generator using Python, allowing users to encode information (such as URLs, text, or contact details) into scannable QR codes. These QR codes can be used for various purposes, including sharing links, encoding personal data, or storing other textual information securely and efficiently.

Key Features:
Data Encoding: The program takes input data (such as text, URLs, or any string) and converts it into a QR code.
Customizable Output: Users can specify the size and color of the QR code, ensuring flexibility in its design.
Image Export: The generated QR code is saved as an image file (e.g., PNG or JPEG), which can be easily shared or printed.
Error Correction: Supports different error correction levels (L, M, Q, H), allowing the QR code to be scanned even if slightly damaged.
